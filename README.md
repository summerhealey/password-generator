This is an JavaScript application has been created for employees at our client's company to ensure that employees are able to access sensitive data while maintaining security. The client requested an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. They also requested that the application maintain a clean and polished user interface, that it was responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes, and that it run in the browser, featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by the JavaScript code.
